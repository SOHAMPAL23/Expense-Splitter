After login or signin the website will take you the page where you will add total budget and can add whatever expenses you have done so far.And even if you want to delete them you can do it and even clear history.
And if you went on a trip where many of your friends have taken your money or you have taken their money then you can just add it as given in the image and delete after it is sorted.
And you have even option to log also but I think you wont do that as it is very helpful to take care your financial freedom.
